## My process

### Built with

- Next JS
- Tallwind CSS
- Tailwind-Styled-Components
- Styled-Components
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to setup tailwind-css and styled-components in Next JS.
I learnt more tricks about mobile responsive design.
I also learnt new features on tailwind css. For example, configuring screen sizes and all that.
I learnt how to use react-reveal animations. It's really cool.

### Continued development

What next after this project? Well, it's to keep building more projects on Frontend Mentor and also learning new things along the way.

### Useful Resources

- [Example resource 1](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced) - I used this as a guide while setting up styled-components in Next JS. I recommend this to anyone finding it difficult to set up styled-components in Next JS.
